This is a simple project to test the Love2d framework after a long time.

## What is Love2d?

Do you know Balatro? A fucking GOTY contender. It was made with Love2d. Love2d is a framework for making 2D games in Lua. It's free, open-source, and works on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Android, and iOS.

## Why Love2d?

My first game was made with Love2d. It was a simple game where you had run a bugged corridor and avoid the obstacles. I had a lot of fun making it and I want to have fun again.

## Can i make a game with Love2d? Will it be good?

Yes, you can, and it can be good. But game development is probably the hardest thing you can do in programming. You need to have a lot of patience and dedication to make a good game. But you can start with Love2d and see if you like it. It requires a lot of creativity and problem-solving skills. The TRUE full-stack development.

## Why this project?

I want to test the Love2d framework again and see if I can make something cool with it. Now i'm a professional developer and I want to see how much I can do with my current knowledge.
In this repo will be a lot of random stuff that I will make with Love2d. I don't know if i will have time and patience to make a full game, but I will try to make something cool.

## Can i run this project on browser?

No, you can't. Love2d is a framework that runs on the desktop. You need to install it on your machine to run this project.

I don't have any ideia if one day some js framework will be able to run Love2d projects on the browser. But it would be cool.

## What I want to learn?

I don't have any idea of what I want to learn. I just want to have fun and see what I can do with Love2d.
