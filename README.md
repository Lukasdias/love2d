## What is Love2d?

Do you know Balatro? A fucking GOTY contender. It was made with Love2d. Love2d is a framework for making 2D games in Lua. It's free, open-source, and works on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Android, and iOS.

## Why Love2d?

My first game was made with Love2d. It was a simple game where you had run a bugged corridor and avoid the obstacles. I had a lot of fun making it and I want to have fun again.

## Why this project?

I want to test the Love2d framework again and see if I can make something cool with it. I want to make a simple game with a ball that follows the mouse. Now i'm a professional developer and I want to see how much I can do with my current knowledge.

## What I want to learn?

I don't have any idea of what I want to learn. I just want to have fun and see what I can do with Love2d.
